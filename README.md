# Project April

Project April (aka AprilOS or just April) is an operating system that I am working on. I plan to implement everything from scratch to gain knowledge and insight into how an operating system and computers in general work. When I say *everything* will be made from scratch, I really do mean *everything*. Of course, I am allowed to use existing languages such as Assembly and C/C++. I am also allowed to use external libraries for cases in which it is impractical to build my own implementation. (Example could be UEFI. I haven't looked too much into UEFI, but it seems that there are libraries which give you a UEFI boilerplate)

It should be noted that this is my first time dabbling in anything low-level, basically. I have used a little bit of C++ a while ago, and now I want to really get to know computers, hence this project. It also means that in places, my code could have poor organisation, or just be filled with bad coding practices. In that case, please submit an issue. I am open to suggestions!
